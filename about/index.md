I have around 5 years of professional experience in iOS, Android and their communication with the server side. I develop professional applications some of them are available on AppStore and Google Play Store.

During my education I have performed my best. In BSCS I received the Gold Medal from Prime-minister of Pakistan 'Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani'.

I always like to work on a challenging position in software development to apply and enhance my technical knowledge, interpersonal skills and creative thinking with a keen desire to make substantial and positive impacts towards success of the organization and my own career growth.
